This repository contains my Tech Basics II Exam Project code. I have built a MVP for an Calendar ToDo List:

When you run the app.py you are greeted with a homepage, which has two buttons - one for a new user and one for the returning user.
If this is the users first time on the app, then they will click on the new user button and register some information. This is data is stored in a .csv file. For this MVP I am sharing my test users data, but data privacy will be extremely important when I launch my app.
If this the user has already registered, they can go to the returning user page and login with their information.
Once a user registers or successfully logs in, they will be taken to the Online Pet Page where the pet changes based on the mood the user selects.
